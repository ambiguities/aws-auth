ASSUME()                                                                ASSUME()



NAME
       assume -

DESCRIPTION
       This command allows users to create an assume a role in an AWS account 
       provided that the profile being used to assume that role has the proper 
       IAM policies allowing the role to be assumed.

SYNOPSIS
            assume
            source_profile
            target_profile
            role_arn
            [session_name]

OPTIONS
       source_profile
          The source profile associated with the IAM user requesting an mfa 
          authorized session.

       target_profile
          The target profile that the mfa authorized session is to be 
          associated with.

       role_arn
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the role to assume.

       session_name
          An identifier for the assumed role session.

          Use  the  role  session name to uniquely identify a session when the
          same role is assumed by different principals or for  different  rea-
          sons.  In  cross-account scenarios, the role session name is visible
          to, and can be logged by the account that owns the  role.  The  role
          session  name is also used in the ARN of the assumed role principal.
          This means that subsequent cross-account API requests that  use  the
          temporary  security credentials will expose the role session name to
          the external account in their AWS CloudTrail logs.

          The regex used to validate this parameter is a string of  characters
          consisting  of upper- and lower-case alphanumeric characters with no
          spaces. You can also include underscores or  any  of  the  following
          characters: =,.@-
